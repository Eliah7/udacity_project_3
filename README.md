# Recommendations with IBM

This repository contains the implementation of the "Recommendations with IBM" project as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program. The project aims to build a recommendation system using user interaction data provided by IBM.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations for new articles they might like. The project involves several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building recommendation models using different techniques.

## Files in the Repository

- `Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb`: The main notebook file where the project is implemented.
- `Recommendations_with_IBM.html`: The 
- `README.md`: This README file explaining the project and its structure.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following sections:

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Understand the structure and characteristics of the data.

2. **Rank-Based Recommendations**
   - Create a recommendation system based on the most popular articles.

3. **User-User Based Collaborative Filtering**
   - Build a recommendation system using user similarity.
   - Implement functions to compute similarity and make recommendations.

4. **Content-Based Recommendations (Optional)**
   - Implement a content-based recommendation system using article metadata.
  
5. **Matrix Factorization**
   - Use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to create a recommendation system.
   - Train and evaluate the performance of the model.

6. **Conclusion**
   - Summarize the findings and discuss potential improvements.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Running the Notebook

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed.

Open the Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and see the results.

## Results

The results of the analysis and the performance of different recommendation systems are documented within the notebook.

The final recommendation model is evaluated based on its ability to predict user interactions with articles.
